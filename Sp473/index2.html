      <p>Our main goal is to monitor the cleanliness levels in public restrooms like the ones present in Railway Stations and Bus Terminuses. These restrooms are visited by a lot of people, and these restrooms get polluted easily. The problem is these restrooms get very less maintanance. As a result a new person going in to use it , might be exposed to a very unclean environment containing various germs and viruses.</p>
      
      <p>So we have installed sensors at our client sites, which monitor the bathroom. One monitors the germs present in the surfaces by scanning it. The other tests for any gases like nitrogen or any unwated smell(like cigarette). The readings of these 2 are sent via internet to the website. If the readings cross a particular threshold , the box containing the readings will be turned red and we will be prompted to take action. If the reading is normal the box will be in green.
