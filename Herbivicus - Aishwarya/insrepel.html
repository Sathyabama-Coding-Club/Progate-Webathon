                <p class="post-text">
                    The intense scent and oil in basil and many other herbs are often used to deter common household pests. Basil may smell delicious to us when it's used in a zesty tomato sauce, but it smells terrible to bugs
                    <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Ocimum basilicum</i>
                    <br><b>Benefits:</b> The pungent herb seems to repel flies and basil pest control has been used since ancient times.

                    Marigolds are downright beautiful, and though my family has always planted them, I didn't know they were bug repellants. It is indeed an aethestic flower as they are used in large amounts in "Pooja" and Temples.

                    <br><b>Benefits:</b>  contain [p]yrethrum, a compound used in many insect repellants. </p>

                    Many people have enjoyed the pleasing fragrance of lavender and used it to treat a variety of conditions. People say its uses range from helping them calm down and get a good nightâ€™s sleep. As someone who's grown lavender and has pollen allergies, I suggest growing a lavender bush on your porch or balcony rather than full-on bringing it into the house.
                    <br><b>Botanical name:</b> <i>Lavandula</i>
                    <br><b>Benefits:</b></b>  lavender oil can help you slay infestations of fleas, black beetles, and several types of flies.

                    Your cats are about to be incredibly happy. Believe it or not, catnip appears to be excellent at keeping bugs, including mosquitoes, at bay.

                    <br><b>Benefits:</b> Nepetalactone, the essential oil in catnip that gives the plant its characteristic odor, is about ten times more effective at repelling mosquitoes
